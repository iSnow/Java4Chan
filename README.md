# Java Library for 4chan

This is the source code for a current WIP library for the 4chan API, forked from https://github.com/camelKaiser/JavaCh. 
Feel free to download and test with the current limited functionality. (Currently as of 2016-12-29)

##How do I test this?
For now, I've uploaded the .jar in the /docs directory. 

##Documentation
